# Gnosis Auction Front-end

## Development

### Install Dependencies

```bash
yarn
```

### Configure Environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and change the appropriate variables.

### Run

```bash
yarn start

To have the frontend default to a different network, make a copy of `.env` named `.env.local`,
change `REACT_APP_NETWORK_ID` to `{yourNetworkId}`, and change `REACT_APP_NETWORK_URL` to e.g.
`https://{yourNetwork}.infura.io/v3/{yourKey}`.
