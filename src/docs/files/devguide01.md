#### Overview

Gnosis Auction is a protocol that enables Batch auctions for everyone. The protocol aims to provide a resilient and easy-to-use tool that enables anybody to auction ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum. 

#### Batch Auctions

Batch auctions are a fair pricing method that has been battle tested in traditional finance. Some of its uses include everydays Open auction in the NYSE, Direct listings, as well as in IPOs (Google being the most prominent). 

Gnosis Auction’s mechanism adds few major benefits over existing approaches available today on Ethereum like fixed price sales, Dutch Auctions, IBCO or Balancer LBP. Gnosis Auction is front running resistant, offers user friendly bidding experience, enables users full control over their participation price, and offers a fair single clearing price. 

#### Benefits 

- **Front running resistant -** Gnosis Auctions prevents front running bots from extracting value by getting tokens early and then dumping them shortly after at a higher price.
- **User friendly bidding experience -** In contrast with other mechanisms, Gnosis Auctions enables bidders to bid at their leisure without needing to time their activity in order to get the desired price.
- **Full control over participation price -** One of Gnosis Auction advantages is the user’s ability to limit the price / valuation at which she is willing to participate in. In contrast, IBCO requires the bidder to commit to participation without knowing the eventual price / valuation of participation.
- **Fair pricing -** All bidders will participate with the same uniform clearing price which will be determined when that auction concludes. No one gets the advantage of participating at a lower price compared to other participants.
