**Important notice to auction participants:**

Gnosis Auction enables permissionless P2P auctions applying a batch auction mechanism without the need for intermediaries. Auctions are initiated and organised by the auctioneers. Gnosis Auction and GnosisDAO do not control, initiate or organise auctions nor are we involved with the auctioneers. Please do your own due diligence before participating in an auction.


#### Typography

Typography is a major part of the Gnosis brand. We've taken care to select a family of fonts that promote legibility and accessibility.

We use [**Averta** font family](https://www.fonts.com/font/intelligent-design/averta?QueryFontType=Web&src=GoogleWebFonts) as a first choice. Otherwise we use [**Poppins**](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?query=Poppins).
