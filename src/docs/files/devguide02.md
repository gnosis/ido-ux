#### How do Batch Auctions work?

1. In batch auctions, there is one seller and multiple bidders. 

2. The seller selects the amount of an asset he wants to sell and determines the minimum price he is willing to receive for the assets. 

3. The auction kicks off, and will last for a specified time. Bidders are free to place their bids once the auction starts.

4. After the specified time is over, the auction ends, and no more bids can be placed. 

5. The bids are then considered from the one with the highest price, and the bought amount for each bid is added up and halted at the bid where the full sell amount is bid upon.

6. This last bid will determine the closing price for all participants. Higher bids will be filled at this closing prices, and lower bids will not be considered.
