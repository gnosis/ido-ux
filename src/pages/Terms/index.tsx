              We provide a graphical user interface (the <strong>&quot;Platform&quot;</strong>) to

            <LiMultiNumber>
              The Protocol was developed by Gnosis Limited and is governed by a series of smart
              contracts that allow permissionless peer-to-peer auctions between users applying a
              batch auction mechanism and without the need for intermediaries on the Ethereum
              Blockchain. We are not a custodian or a counterparty to any transactions executed by
              you on the Protocol. We do not support any other service, particularly we do not
              provide any order matching, guaranteed prices, or similar exchange or trading platform
              services.

          <OrderedListMultiNumber>
            <LiMultiNumber>
              We do not levy any fees on users of our Platform at this moment in time. This may
              however change in the future. Fees are incurred at the Protocol level and amount to a
              maximum of 1.5% of the tokens deposited by the seller to be auctioned.
            </LiMultiNumber>
            <LiMultiNumber>
              Users interacting with the Ethereum Blockchain will incur network fees (so called gas
              costs). Gas costs are independent of the Platform and go to miners processing the
              transaction on the Ethereum Blockchain. We have no control over and do not set the gas
              costs, and do not benefit from them. Gas costs are calculated by multiplying the gas
              price with the gas used. The Platform does not change the default suggestion of your
              wallet provider. Gas costs may differ significantly, depending on the ETH-USD rate and
              network usage at the transaction time. Users may be able to change the default gas
              price within their wallet, depending on the wallet used.

          <Underline>PRICE FLUCTUATIONS</Underline>
          <br />
          ERC20 tokens are neither legal tender backed by governments nor by assets. The
          tokens&apos; value is highly volatile causing price fluctuations, as auctions typically
          run for some time and trades are not executed instantly.

          <Underline>REGULATORY ACTION</Underline>
          <br />
          We could be impacted by regulatory inquiries or action, which could impede or limit your
          ability to access or use the Platform.

          <Underline>TECHNICAL UNDERSTANDING</Underline>
          <br />
          Cryptographic assets are described in technical language requiring a comprehensive
          understanding of computer science and mathematics to appreciate the inherent risks.

          <Underline>TRANSACTIONS ON ETHEREUM BLOCKCHAIN ARE IMMUTABLE AND IRREVERSIBLE</Underline>
          <br />
          Transactions on Ethereum Blockchain are generally immutable and irreversible. Any
          transaction thereon is therefore irrevocable and final as soon as it is settled thereon.
          In the event that you send your tokens to sell to any other destination other than the
          Protocol smart contracts, such tokens may not be returned. We assume no responsibility and
          shall have no obligation to you if this occurs, including but not limited to any
          responsibility to recover, or assist to recover, any such tokens.

          <Underline>THIRD PARTY DATA CENTRE FAILURES</Underline>
          <br />
          Our Platform may in part be established on servers at data centre facilities of third
          party providers. We may be required to transfer our Platform to different facilities, and
          may incur service interruption in connection with such relocation. Data centre facilities
          are vulnerable to force majeure events or other failures. Third party providers may suffer
          breaches of security and others may obtain unauthorised access to our server data. As
          techniques used to obtain unauthorised access change frequently and generally are not
          recognised until used against a target, it may not be possible to anticipate these
          techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures.
